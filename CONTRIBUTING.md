# Contributing

Your contributions are welcome! Please try to be constructive and follow the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We use Imba,  a programming language made in Norway, for notion2anki development. As early supporters of Imba, we encourage you to learn more about it and contribute to our project in Imba. Here are some resources you can use to learn Imba:
- [Imba website](https://v2.imba.io)
- You can try running Imba locally by following the instructions on [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/imba/imba.io/tree/v2) (make sure you are in v2 branch).
- There is also a Visual Studio Code extension that'll help you with development in Imba. You can get it [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=scrimba.vsimba)
- If you want to see Imba in action, you can visit [notion2anki](https://2anki.net) or [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).
- You can create an **Imba playground** in **Scrimba** if you are curious but not sure about using it locally.

Thanks for your interest in notion2anki. We hope you'll try Imba and contribute to our project. We are looking forward to your pull requests!
